# Federated Recommender Systems
Code from "Federating Recommendations Using Differentially Private Prototypes"

USAGE:
-	.py files contain main functions and subroutines. 
-	The three .ipynb files are notebooks with explanations on running and plotting results. 
-	All results and figures are saved on individual folders exp1, exp2, exp3. Current files in the folders are from our experiments but they can be overwritten by running the code in the  notebooks. 
- unfortunately we cannot provide the data for the last experiment but its access can be requested at https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/
